# My Python Journey

Welcome to my Python repository! This is where I document my learning journey and progress as I explore Python programming.

## About

I’ve recently started learning Python, and this repository serves as a collection of all my practice scripts, small projects, and coding challenges. It’s a place for me to track my growth, experiment with new concepts, and improve my coding skills.

## Current Focus

- **Basic Syntax**: Understanding Python’s core structure and conventions.
- **Data Types**: Practicing with lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- **Control Flow**: Learning how to use loops, conditionals, and functions effectively.

## Future Goals

- **File Handling**: Work with reading and writing files.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Dive into classes, objects, and methods.
- **Web Development**: Explore how Python can be used for backend development with frameworks like Flask or Django.

## How to Follow My Progress

I’ll keep updating this repository as I continue my journey. Feel free to browse through the scripts, leave feedback, or suggest improvements!
